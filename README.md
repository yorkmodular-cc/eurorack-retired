# eurorack-retired

This repo contains schematics, panel files and suchlike for my 'retired' and/or discontinued Eurorack modules. 

They are placed here in the hope that they may be useful to some people - in a lot of the cases I've either refined the design or shelved it altogether. No warranty is given or implied - all of the designs are known to work but I accept no responsibility if you screw something up.
